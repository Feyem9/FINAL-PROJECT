# Student Dashboard Update - Real Data Integration

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Updated Sdashboard.jsx
- ✅ Added React hooks (useState, useEffect) and axios import
- ✅ Added databaseUri from environment variables
- ✅ Added userId retrieval from localStorage
- ✅ Implemented API call to fetch enrolled courses from backend
- ✅ Updated ProgressOverview component to use real course data
- ✅ Updated StatsCards component to calculate stats from real data
- ✅ Added loading state for better UX
- ✅ Commented out old hardcoded data as requested
- ✅ Maintained existing dashboard structure and layout

### 2. Backend Integration
- ✅ Verified student controller has `/students/:id/enrolled-courses` endpoint
- ✅ Confirmed course data structure matches frontend expectations
- ✅ API call follows same pattern as other components (Scourse.jsx)

### 3. Data Mapping
- ✅ Course titles mapped to progress overview
- ✅ Course count used for "Courses Enrolled" stat
- ✅ Mock progress data added (can be replaced with real progress API later)
- ✅ Mock assignments/quizzes data (can be replaced with real data later)

## Current Status
The student dashboard now fetches and displays real course data from the backend while maintaining the original structure and design. The dashboard shows:
- Real number of enrolled courses
- Course titles in progress overview
- Dynamic time display
- Loading state during data fetch

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Add real progress tracking API endpoint
- [ ] Add assignments/quizzes API endpoints
- [ ] Add recent activities API endpoint
- [ ] Add upcoming tasks API endpoint
- [ ] Add weekly goals API endpoint

## Notes
- Old hardcoded data is commented out, not deleted
- Structure and styling remain unchanged
- Error handling included for API calls
- Follows same patterns as other components in the codebase
